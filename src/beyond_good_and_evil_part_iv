He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously--and even
himself--only in relation to his pupils.
%
"Knowledge for its own sake"--that is the last snare laid by morality:
we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more.
%
The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has to
be overcome on the way to it.
%
65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED
to sin.
%
The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed,
deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.
%
Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of
all others. Love to God also!
%
"I did that," says my memory. "I could not have done that," says my pride,
and remains inexorable. Eventually--the memory yields.
%
One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand
that--kills with leniency.
%
If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which
always recurs.
%
THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER.--So long as thou feelest the stars as an "above
thee," thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.
%
It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that makes
great men.
%
He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.
%
73A. Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye--and calls it his pride.

A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things
besides: gratitude and purity.

altitudes of his spirit.
%
Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself.
%
With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify, or honour,

probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith.

He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as
a despiser.
%
A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love, betrays
its sediment: its dregs come up.
%
A thing that is explained ceases to concern us--What did the God mean
who gave the advice, "Know thyself!" Did it perhaps imply "Cease to
be concerned about thyself! become objective!"--And Socrates?--And the
"scientific man"?
%
It is terrible to die of thirst at sea. Is it necessary that you should
so salt your truth that it will no longer--quench thirst?
%
"Sympathy for all"--would be harshness and tyranny for THEE, my good
neighbour.
%
INSTINCT--When the house is on fire one forgets even the dinner--Yes,
but one recovers it from among the ashes.
%
Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she--forgets how to charm.
%
The same emotions are in man and woman, but in different TEMPO, on that
account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other.
%
In the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves have
still their impersonal scorn--for "woman".
%
FETTERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT--When one firmly fetters one's heart and
keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: I said this
once before But people do not believe it when I say so, unless they know
it already.
%
One begins to distrust very clever persons when they become embarrassed.
%
Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences them
is not something dreadful also.

Heavy, melancholy men turn lighter, and come temporarily to their surface,
precisely by that which makes others heavy--by hatred and love.

Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!--And for that very reason
many think him red-hot.
%
Who has not, at one time or another--sacrificed himself for the sake of
his good name?

one had as a child at play.
%
To be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end of
which one is ashamed also of one's morality.
%
One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa--blessing it
rather than in love with it.
%
What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own ideal.
%
When one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites.
%
THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS--"I listened for the echo and I heard only
praise."
%
We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus relax
ourselves away from our fellows.
%
A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the
animalization of God.
%
Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with
regard to the beloved. "What! She is modest enough to love even you? Or
stupid enough? Or--or---"
%
THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.--"Everything now turns out best for me, I now
love every fate:--who would like to be my fate?"
%
Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love, prevents
the Christians of today--burning us.
%
The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the "piety") of
the free spirit (the "pious man of knowledge") than the impia fraus.
Hence the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the Church,
characteristic of the type "free spirit"--as ITS non-freedom.
%
By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.
%
A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been taken, to
shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. Occasionally, therefore,
a will to stupidity.
%
There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral interpretation
of phenomena.

%
Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been
wounded.
%
To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to belief,
all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against them.

The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the coyness in
this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset.

has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day.
%
Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning
ourselves--"justifying" ourselves.

heart--and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.

He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because of
the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.

his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.
%
A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great men.--Yes,
and then to get round them.

worse still! under their dress and finery.
%
The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you allure
the senses to it.
%
The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that account he
keeps so far away from him:--the devil, in effect, as the oldest friend
of knowledge.
%
What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent decreases,--when
he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an adornment; an
adornment is also a concealment.
%
The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that
in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal,

she may have assumed the peaceable demeanour.
%
One is punished best for one's virtues.
%
He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and

all evidence of truth.
%
Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable part
of it is rather an essential condition of being good.
%
The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other seeks some one
whom he can assist: a good conversation thus originates.
%
In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of
opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a
mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very
remarkable man.
%

him with whom we have intercourse--and forget it immediately.
%
In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.
%
ADVICE AS A RIDDLE.--"If the band is not to break, bite it first--secure
to make!"

The belly is the reason why man does not so readily take himself for
a God.
%
The chastest utterance I ever heard: "Dans le veritable amour c'est
l'ame qui enveloppe le corps."
%
Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is most
difficult to us.--Concerning the origin of many systems of morals.
%
When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally something
wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself conduces to a certain
virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may say so, is "the barren animal."
%
Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would not
have the genius for adornment, if she had not the instinct for the
SECONDARY role.
%
He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a
monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze
into thee.
%
From old Florentine novels--moreover, from life: Buona femmina e mala

%
To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and afterwards to
believe implicitly in this opinion of their neighbour--who can do this
conjuring trick so well as women?
%
That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable echo of what
was formerly considered good--the atavism of an old ideal.
%
Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the demigod
everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God everything
becomes--what? perhaps a "world"?
%
It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have your permission
to possess it;--eh, my friends?
%
"Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always Paradise": so
say the most ancient and the most modern serpents.
%
What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.
%
Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of
health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.
%
The sense of the tragic increases and declines with sensuousness.
%
Insanity in individuals is something rare--but in groups, parties,
nations, and epochs it is the rule.
%
The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one gets
successfully through many a bad night.
%
Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to our strongest
impulse--the tyrant in us.
%
One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us good
or ill?
%
One no longer loves one's knowledge sufficiently after one has
communicated it.
%
Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they exploit them.
%
"Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our neighbour's
neighbour":--so thinks every nation.
%
Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover--his
rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to
his normal character.
%
Jesus said to his Jews: "The law was for servants;--love God as I love
him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!"
%
IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY.--A shepherd has always need of a bell-wether--or

%
One may indeed lie with the mouth; but with the accompanying grimace
one nevertheless tells the truth.
%
To vigorous men intimacy is a matter of shame--and something precious.

%
In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.
%
Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge, like tender
hands on a Cyclops.
%
One occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to mankind
(because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one must never confess
to the individual.
%
One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when one esteems
equal or superior.
%
Ye Utilitarians--ye, too, love the UTILE only as a VEHICLE for your
inclinations,--ye, too, really find the noise of its wheels insupportable!
%
One loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired.
%
The vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is counter to
our vanity.
%
With regard to what "truthfulness" is, perhaps nobody has ever been
sufficiently truthful.
%
One does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a forfeiture of
the rights of man!
%
The consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock, very indifferent
to the fact that we have meanwhile "reformed."

It is inhuman to bless when one is being cursed.
%
The familiarity of superiors embitters one, because it may not be
returned.
%

answer so?
