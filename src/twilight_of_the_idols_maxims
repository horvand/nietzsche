Idleness is the beginning of all psychology. What? Should psychology be
a vice?
%
Even the most courageous among us only rarely has the courage for that
which he really knows.
%
To live alone one must be a beast or a god, says Aristotle. Leaving out
the third case: one must be both--a philosopher.
%
"All truth is simple." Is that not doubly a lie?
%
I want, once and for all, not to know many things. Wisdom sets limits
to knowledge too.
%
In our own wild nature we find the best recreation from our un-nature,
from our spirituality.
%
What? Is man merely a mistake of God's? Or God merely a mistake of man's?
%
Out of life's school of war: What does not destroy me, makes me stronger.
%
Help yourself, then everyone will help you. Principle of neighbor-love.
%
Not to perpetrate cowardice against one's own acts! Not to leave them
in the lurch afterward! The bite of conscience is indecent.
%
Can an ass be tragic? To perish under a burden one can neither bear nor
throw off? The case of the philosopher.
%
If we have our own why of life, we shall get along with almost any
how. Man does not strive for pleasure; only the Englishman does.
%
Man has created woman--out of what? Out of a rib of his god--of his
"ideal."
%
What? You search? You would multiply yourself by ten, by a hundred? You
seek followers? Seek zeros!
%
Posthumous men--I, for example--are understood worse than timely ones,
but heard better. More precisely: we are never understood--hence our
authority.
%
Among women: "Truth? Oh, you don't know truth! Is it not an attempt to
assassinate all our pudeurs?"
%
That is an artist as I love artists, modest in his needs: he really
wants only two things, his bread and his art--panem et Circen. ["bread
and Circe"]
%
Whoever does not know how to lay his will into things, at least lays
some meaning into them: that means, he has the faith that they already
obey a will. (Principle of "faith.)
%
What? You elected virtue and the swelled bosom and yet you leer enviously
at the advantages of those without qualms? But virtue involves renouncing
"advantages." (Inscription for an anti-Semite's door.)
%
The perfect woman perpetrates literature as she perpetrates a small sin:
as an experiment, in passing, looking around to see if anybody notices
it--and to make sure that somebody does.
%
To venture into all sorts of situations in which one may not have any
sham virtues, where, like the tightrope walker on his rope, one either
stands or falls--or gets away.
%
"Evil men have no songs." How is it, then, that the Russians have songs?
%
"German spirit": for the past eighteen years a contradiction in terms.
%
By searching out origins, one becomes a crab. The historian looks
backward; eventually he also believes backward.
%
Contentment protects even against colds. Has a woman who knew herself
to be well dressed ever caught cold? I am assuming that she was barely
dressed.
%
I mistrust all systematizers and I avoid them. The will to a system is
a lack of integrity.
%
Women are considered profound. Why? Because one never fathoms their
depths. Women aren't even shallow.
%
If a woman has manly virtues, one feels like running away; and if she
has no manly virtues, she herself runs away.
%
"How much conscience has had to chew on in the past! And what excellent
teeth it had! And today--what is lacking?" A dentist's question.
%
One rarely rushes into a single error. Rushing into the first one, one
always does too much. So one usually perpetrates another one--and now
one does too little.
%
When stepped on, a worm doubles up. That is clever. In that way he
lessens the probability of being stepped on again. In the language of
morality: humility.
%
There is a hatred of lies and simulation, stemming from an easily
provoked sense of honor. There is another such hatred, from cowardice,
since lies are forbidden by a divine commandment. Too cowardly to lie.
%
How little is required for pleasure! The sound of a bagpipe. Without
music, life would be an error. The German imagines even God singing songs.
%
On ne peut penser et ecrire qu'assis [One cannot think and write except
when seated] (G. Flaubert). There I have caught you, nihilist! The
sedentary life is the very sin against the Holy Spirit. Only thoughts
reached by walking have value.
%
There are cases in which we are like horses, we psychologists, and
become restless: we see our own shadow wavering up and down before us. A
psychologist must turn his eyes from himself to eye anything at all.
%
Whether we immoralists are harming virtue? Just as little as anarchists
harm princes. Only since the latter are shot at do they again sit securely
on their thrones. Moral: morality must be shot at.
%
You run ahead? Are you doing it as a shepherd? Or as an exception? A
third case would be the fugitive. First question of conscience.
%
Are you genuine? Or merely an actor? A representative? Or that which is
represented? In the end, perhaps you are merely a copy of an actor. Second
question of conscience.
%
The disappointed one speaks. I searched for great human beings; I always
found only the apes of their ideals.
%
Are you one who looks on? Or one who lends a hand? Or one who looks away
and walks off? Third question of conscience.
%
Do you want to walk along? Or walk ahead? Or walk by yourself? One must
know what one wants and that one wants. Fourth question of conscience.
%
Those were steps for me, and I have climbed up over them: to that end
I had to pass over them. Yet they thought that I wanted to retire on them.
%
What does it matter if I remain right. I am much too right. And he who
laughs best today will also laugh last.
%
The formula of my happiness: a Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal.
